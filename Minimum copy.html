            <p><span>The UAB Acceptable Use Policy outlines acceptable use of computing and network resources at UAB.
                    The Policy states that computing devices must meet specific technical and security standards before
                    connection to the University network and that computing devices must meet specific protection
                    requirements before storing or transmitting sensitive or restricted data.</span></p>
