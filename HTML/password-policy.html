    <h3 id='s_1-0'>1.0 Introduction</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this standard is to define password requirements for users, servers, and applications at UAB.</p>
    <h3 id='s_2-0'>2.0 Scope and Applicability</h3>
    <p>This standard applies to all users and systems at UAB which utilize BlazerIDs.</p>
    <h3 id='s_3-0'>3.0 Password Standard</h3>
    <p>Length: All account passwords on systems leveraging BlazerIDs will be a minimum of 15 characters and a maximum of
        32 characters. Other account passwords not using BlazerIDs shall be required to request an exception.</p>
    <p>a. System Accounts will be complex, 32 characters and have no expiration.</p>
    <p>b. Vendor supplied, pre-configured, default passwords are forbidden.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Lockout: After 6 failed login attempts, accounts should be disabled and locked out for at least 30 minutes
            where feasible.</li>
        <li>Expiration: All user account passwords shall expire annually unless authentication is protected by
            University provided two-factor authentication or approved biometrics. All privileged user account or
            administrator passwords shall expire at intervals as required by regulation (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA, etc.).</li>
        <li>Password Reset after Compromise or Disclosure: Password resets will be required in situations where
            continued use of a password creates risk of unauthorized access to the computing account or resource.</li>
        <li>History: Password / passphrase history shall be kept to prevent the previous (1) password from re-use.</li>
        <li>Caching: Applications or Systems that utilize BlazerIDs shall not cache BlazerID passwords / passphrases,
            even if hashed or otherwise encrypted, without an approved exception. Individual devices such as smartphone,
            tablets, etc. are not included.</li>
        <li>Complexity: Passwords shall contain at least one character from three of the following ASCII character sets:
            lowercase alphabetic, uppercase alphabetic, and numbers.</li>
        <li>Logging: Systems shall log successful and failed logon attempts and retain such logs for a minimum of 90
            calendar days.</li>
        <li>Encryption: A one-way hash function wherever possible is required for storing passwords.</li>
        <li>Unused Accounts: Student accounts unused for more than 180 days shall be disabled. All other accounts unused
            for more than 90 days shall be disabled.</li>
        <li>Registration: Applications that leverage BlazerID authentication through a central mechanism/system must be
            registered with UAB IT.</li>
        <li>Password Strength: Passwords will be checked against known bad passwords and common passwords to determine
            strength of the password.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3 id='s_4-0'>4.0 Enforcement</h3>
    <p>The Office of the Vice President for Information Technology is responsible for this standard and will
        programmatically enforce it through the UAB IT Enterprise Identity Management (IDM) organization.</p>
