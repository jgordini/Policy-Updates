<h3 id="s_1-0">1.0 Overview</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.uab.edu/policies/content/Pages/UAB-IT-POL-0000004.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UAB Acceptable Use Policy</a> outlines acceptable use of computing and network resources at UAB. The Policy states that computing devices must meet specific technical and security standards before connection to the University network and that computing devices must meet specific protection requirements before storing or transmitting sensitive or restricted data.</p>
<h3 id="s_2-0">2.0 Objective/Purpose</h3>
<p>This document outlines the minimum security standards that are required for all computing devices owned by UAB and/or connected to the UAB network, along with all devices that store or transmit Restricted or Sensitive data, as defined by the UAB <a href="/it/home/policies/data-classification/classification-rule">Data Classification Rule</a>. This document also governs all enforcement procedures and exception requests tied to the Minimum Security for Computing Devices Rule. The purpose of these requirements is to reduce the risk to the security of individual systems and data while mitigating risks to the operation of the UAB network.</p>
<h3 id="s_3-0">3.0 Security Standards Rule</h3>
<p>UAB Information Security has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Security</a> as the basis for the university-wide set of security standards and guidelines.</p>

<h4 id="s_6-1">6.1 Roles and Responsibilities</h4>
<p>Each University academic and business unit is responsible for implementing, reviewing and monitoring internal policies, practices, etc. to assure compliance with this standard security rule.</p>
<p>The VP of Information Technology Office is responsible for enforcing this standard security rule.</p>
<h4 id="s_6-2">6.2 Consequences and Sanctions</h4>
<p>Non-compliance with these standards may incur the same types of disciplinary measures and consequences as violations of other University policies, including progressive discipline up to and including termination of employment. In the cases where students are involved, such issues will result in the reporting of a <a href="https://www.uab.edu/compliance/code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Code of Conduct</a> violation.</p>
<p>Any device that does not meet the minimum security requirements outlined in this standard may be removed from the UAB network, disabled, etc., as appropriate until the device can comply with this standard.</p>
<h3 id="s_7-0">7.0 Exceptions</h3>
<p>Exceptions may be granted in cases where security risks have mitigating controls in place to lessen the intensity from a critical to a minimal level. To request a security exception, complete the <a href="https://uabprod.service-now.com/service_portal?id=sc_category&amp;sys_id=b179a61437d34e8024a67c1643990e80" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UAB Security Policy Exception Request</a> from the UAB IT Tech Help portal.</p>
