    <h3 id='s_1-0'>1.0 Introduction</h3>
    <p>Patch management is a critical preventive measure designed to proactively counter the exploitation of
        vulnerabilities that exist within UAB systems. By taking a proactive approach to managing vulnerabilities, the
        University is able to reduce or eliminate the potential for exploitation and prevent the excessive time, effort,
        and costs that result when responding to an incident after it has occurred.</p>
    <p>Patching may require systems to be rebooted in order for the patch to be applied. Commensurate with this, the
        disruption to the systems being patched should be minimized by using a preferred window of weekends.</p>
    <h3 id='s_2-0'>2.0 Scope and Applicability</h3>
    <p>All UAB-owned devices as well as devices that store, process, or transmit University data must be proactively
        managed and patched with appropriate security updates.</p>
    <h3 id='s_3-0'>3.0 Patch Management</h3>
    <ol start=''>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Endpoints</strong></p>
            <p>a. Patch management for all endpoints is centrally managed by UAB IT.</p>
            <p>b. All critical operating system and application patches will be installed within thirty (30) days of
                release from the vendor.</p>
            <p>c. UAB IT will prioritize centralized patching efforts in the order of (1) Windows operating systems, (2)
                Apple operating systems, (3) applications such as Adobe, Flash, etc.</p>
            <p>d. Application software vendors release security patches on a regular schedule. For centrally managed
                devices, applicable patches will be tested and validated by UAB IT prior to deployment to campus. Once
                validated UAB IT will schedule and deploy validated patches to end points on a monthly basis. UAB IT
                will communicate with the campus community regarding deployed security patches.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Servers</strong></p>
            <p>a. All university-managed servers will be maintained with the latest security patches to their operating
                systems and applications.</p>
            <p>b. Each service owner is responsible for UAB servers under their control. Each UAB server must have a
                named service owner and system owner. When a patch is announced, an authorized system owner must
                document the change according to formal change management procedures. The service owner must assign a
                criticality rating based on their experience, the classification of the data (per UAB Data
                Classification Rule) contained on the server, and the level of risk to the institution in the event of
                compromise.</p>
            <p>c. All high/critical patches must be applied as soon as practically possible. This period shall not
                exceed thirty (30) calendar days after public release for any business critical production server.</p>
            <p>d. All medium criticality patches or patches for non-critical systems must be applied within sixty (60)
                calendar days.</p>
            <p>e. Any low criticality patches will be installed on a case-by-case basis. All patches should be tested on
                development systems before being rolled out to production, where possible.</p>
            <p>f. In cases where patching cannot follow the standard as outlined above, an exception request form must
                be completed and submitted to the UAB Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for approval. These
                exception requests will only be approved for a maximum of three months and will follow the normal
                exception request process.</p>
            <p>g. All patches for vendor-maintained systems/applications that are labeled as high/critical must also be
                patched within thirty (30) days of the approved release from the vendor. The UAB operating unit is
                responsible for maintaining knowledge of these patches and ensuring that vendors comply with this
                standard.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Endpoint Procedures</strong></p>
            <p>a. Installation and Validation</p>
            <p>i. A system reboot is required to successfully install most security patches. Until the reboot occurs,
                the computer will remain vulnerable to attacks which the installed patch protects against. Security
                updates will be deployed using regularly occurring weekend maintenance windows. UAB IT recognizes that
                flexibility may be needed around a system reboot to provide the university community with the option to
                reboot with minimal impact to productivity and operations. Because of this, exemptions will be allowed
                if requested, provided there is a valid business case.</p>
            <p>ii. There are two exemption methods that will allow users to install scheduled updates at their
                convenience within a pre-determined time-frame.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Users will be provided five (5) business days to select the installation time of their choice for
                    patching. Should the five (5) business days pass without the necessary reboot, updates will
                    automatically install and may enforce reboots of the computer, as the updates require. In order to
                    ensure that end points are protected, and work is not disrupted due to reboot, it is strongly
                    recommended that users install the updates as soon as possible. When updates are available, they
                    will appear in the system tray. This is the preferred update method if an exemption is required.</p>
                <p>In the event that the five (5) business exemption window for patch application could have a negative
                    impact on academic or operating unit processes a special exemption may be granted. Users that feel
                    this is the case may request to be temporarily exempted from the mandatory reboot process. If an
                    exemption is granted, endpoints will still have patches deployed regularly, but it will be the end
                    user&#39;s responsibility to install updates and reboot the machine. Updates will be presented in
                    the same way as the first exemption option; however, the automatic install and reboot is extended to
                    30 days.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>iii. Out-of-Band Updates</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>On occasion, a software vendor will release a critical security patch outside of their normal release
                    cycle. The usual reason for the release of an out of band patch is the appearance of an unexpected,
                    widespread, destructive exploit that will likely affect a large number of users. In the event of a
                    published out-of-band patch, UAB IT will expedite the validation process. Once validated, users will
                    have one (1) business day to install and reboot their machine to apply the patch. In the event that
                    the deadline passes, updates will automatically install and may enforce reboots of your computer as
                    the updates require. UAB IT will communicate with the campus community in the event of an out of
                    band update deployment.</p>
            </blockquote>

                    the server will remain vulnerable to attacks which the installed patch protects against. Security
                    updates will be deployed using regularly scheduled weekend maintenance windows within a quarter of
                    release, and for business critical services should be validated in a development environment first.
                </p>

            <p>ii. Out-of-Band Updates</p>
            <blockquote>

                    event of a published out-of-band security patch, the validation process should be expedited as well
                    as the installation and reboot of the server.</p>
