<h3 id="s_1-0">1.0 Introduction</h3>
<p>The objective of this data protection rule is to assist the UAB community in the protections requirements of data and systems based on the <a href="/it/home/policies/data-classification/classification-rule">Data Classification Rule</a>.</p>
<h3 id="s_2-0">2.0 Scope and Applicability</h3>
<p>All UAB data stored, processed, or transmitted must be protected in accordance with this requirement. Based on classification; users are required to implement appropriate security controls.</p>
<h3 id="s_3-0">3.0 Responsibilities for Protecting Institutional Data</h3>
<p>All UAB data must be classified into one of the three following categories</p>
<h4 id="s_3-1">3.1 Specific Roles and Responsibilities for Protecting Institutional Data</h4>
<h4 id="s_3-2">3.2 Data Stewards have administrative control and are officially accountable for a specific information asset.</h4>
<p>Data Stewards shall:</p>
<ul>
	<li>assign an appropriate classification to the information</li>
	<li>govern processes for determining access to information assets</li>
	<li>ensure compliance with policies and regulatory requirements related to the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: VP of Financial Affairs &amp; Administration - financial and HR data; VP of Research &amp; Economic Development - research administration data; Deans and Unit Chairs and data from their respective academic area.</p>
<h4 id="s_3-3">3.3 Data Custodians safeguard the data on behalf of the Data Steward.</h4>
<p>UAB’s central Information Technology (IT) units shall be responsible for protecting all Institutional Data maintained/stored in the institutional information systems. Distributed Information Technology (IT) units shall be responsible for protecting all Institutional Data maintained/stored in unit level information systems.</p>
<h4 id="s_3-4">3.4 UAB Information Security</h4>
<p>Members of the UAB Information Security team are responsible for developing and implementing an information security program as well as the supporting data security and protection policies, standards and procedures.</p>
<h4 id="s_3-5">3.5 Information Security Liaison (ISL)</h4>
<p>Each unit senior manager will designate at least one ISL who will act as a liaison to the UAB information Security Team. ISLs oversee information security responsibilities for the units and schools, including assisting with security awareness and security incident response.</p>
<h4 id="s_3-6">3.6 System Administrators</h4>
<p>System Administrators are individuals within the central IT/HSIS or school/units with day-to-day responsibility for maintaining information systems.</p>
<h4 id="s_3-7">3.7 Data Users</h4>
<p>Data Users are individuals authorized to access UAB data and are responsible for protecting the information assets on a daily basis through adherence to UAB policies.</p>
<h3 id="s_4-0">4.0 Protection Requirements Based on Classification</h3>
<p>The table below defines minimum protection requirements for each category of data when being used or handled in a specific context (e.g. Sensitive Data sent in an email message). Please note that these protections are not intended to supersede any regulatory or contractual requirements for handling data.</p>
