    <h3 id='s_1-0'>1.0 Introduction</h3>
    <p>This purpose of this document is to describe the process used by University of Alabama at Birmingham Information
        Technology (UAB IT) in mitigating the risks from computer security vulnerabilities. This standard is intended to
        represent a minimum baseline for managing vulnerabilities on UAB systems pursuant to the Data Protection and
        Security policy. Business units may implement more strict standards. This standard may not address every
        requirement for remediation. Risk assessments, data classification, access control processes, and other
        requirements may determine that additional remediation beyond this standard is required for a particular system.
    </p>
    <h3 id='s_2_0'>2.0 Scope and Applicability</h3>
    <p>All systems where UAB data is stored, processed, or transmitted must be regularly reviewed for vulnerabilities.
        Any vulnerability identified will be mitigated based on the criticality of the vulnerability, and the
        classification of data within the system.</p>
    <h3 id='s_3_0'>3.0 Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
    <p><strong>Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)</strong></p>
    <p>The CISO is the owner of the vulnerability management process. The CISO designs the process and ensures is
        implemented as designed. Additionally, the CISO is responsible for approving and overseeing campus use of an
        enterprise scanning and assessment tool. Further, the CISO has the authority to take action as needed, to ensure
        that all systems have vulnerabilities are remediated and that any un-remediated issues do not pose a threat to
        University resources.</p>
    <p><strong>UAB Information Security</strong></p>
    <p>Members of the UAB and UAB Health System Information Security teams are responsible for developing and
        implementing an information security program as well as the supporting data security and protection policies,
        standards and procedures. UAB Information Security is responsible for providing the approved enterprise
        vulnerability management and penetration testing service. Further UAB Information Security is responsible for
        providing the results of vulnerability scanning and penetration testing activities to appropriate system
        administrators and/or Information Security Liaisons, and validating remediation of any noted vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Information Security Liaison (ISL)</strong></p>
    <p>Each unit or department senior manager will designate at least one ISL who will act as a liaison to the UAB
        Information Security team.  ISLs oversee information security responsibilities for the departments, including
        assisting with security awareness and security incident response.</p>
    <p>For UAB covered entities, UAB Health System has established the <a
            href='http://www.hipaa.uab.edu/images/pdfs/resources/Security-Coordinator-Job-Description-7-13.pdf'>Entity

    <p><strong>Data Stewards</strong></p>
    <p>Data Stewards have administrative control and are officially accountable for a specific information asset.  Data
        Stewards are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Responsible for assigning an appropriate classification to the information;</li>
        <li>Accountable for who has access to information assets; and</li>
        <li>Responsible for ensuring compliance with policies and regulatory requirements related to the information.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Data Custodians</strong></p>
    <p>Data Custodians safeguard the data on behalf of the Data Steward.
        UAB&#39;s Central Information Technology (IT) units shall be responsible for protecting all institutional data
        maintained/stored in the institutional information systems.
        UAB Health System Information Services (HSIS) shall be responsible for protecting all Health System data
        maintained/stored in the institutional information systems.</p>
    <p><strong>System Administrators</strong></p>
    <p>System Administrators are individuals within the central IT/HSIS or school/department units with day-to-day
        responsibility for maintaining information systems.  They are responsible for following all data security
        protection procedures and practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Users</strong></p>
    <p>Data Users are individuals authorized to access UAB data and are responsible for protecting the information
        assets on a daily basis through adherence to UAB policies.</p>
    <h3 id='s_4_0'>4.0 Vulnerability Discovery </h3>
    <p>Vulnerabilities in computing devices across campus will be discovered by two means: vulnerability scanning and
        penetration testing. Vulnerability discovery may be conducted from an internal campus network, or an external
        perspective.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>4.1 Vulnerability Scanning</strong></p>
        <p>All computing devices connected to the UAB network, or systems storing or processing UAB business data, are
            required to be scanned for vulnerabilities on a periodic basis. Vulnerability scanning will be conducted on
            a monthly basis as a part of normal production operation. More frequent scanning is recommended for systems
            storing or processing data which is classified as Sensitive or Restricted/PHI, or as required by applicable
            regulations or standard.</p>
        <p>Additionally, scanning activity will occur on an as needed basis under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New service or system prior to becoming Internet-facing,</li>
            <li>Major change with existing information system to revalidate security controls,</li>
            <li>Emerging threat due to newly discovered vulnerability,</li>
            <li>Incident response and recovery.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.2 Penetration Testing</strong></p>
        <p>Penetration testing is required for all UAB mission critical systems, all systems hosting Restricted/PHI or
            Sensitive data, and all Internet-facing systems on no greater than a biennial basis. Penetration testing is
            also required prior to the deployment of new systems and applications or following major changes, service
            rollouts, or system upgrades to existing systems and applications.</p>
        <p>Penetration testing is subject to the Scope and Rules of Engagement, as defined, drafted, and agreed upon by
            UAB Information Security and the responsible ISL or system administrator.</p>
        <p>Any exploitable vulnerabilities discovered during the penetration test are subject to the same remediation
            timelines as defined in the Vulnerability Classification Remediation Timeline.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>4.3 Scanning and Mitigation</strong></p>
    <p>All computing devices connected to the UAB network or systems storing/processing UAB business data are required
        to be scanned for vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanning will include the regular credentialed scanning of
        systems. Additionally, all systems used for remote access must have the vulnerability scanning agent installed.
    </p>
    <p>Information Security Liaisons and/or systems administrators must correct any identified vulnerabilities according
        to this standard, which could include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deploying available updates and/or software patches,</li>
        <li>Performing configuration changes which address the vulnerabilities identified,</li>
        <li>Removing outdated software versions as newer versions are made available.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Information Security Liaisons and/or systems administrators must request and justify all exceptions to mitigate
        according to this standard.</p>
    <p>All university schools, colleges, centers and business units must develop and adhere to procedures for
        vulnerability management, including the regular credentialed scanning of systems. Vulnerability management
        procedures must also address remediating detected vulnerabilities, including timely patch and configuration
        management, effective change management procedures, and reporting the status of issues to the University Risk
        Cabinet.</p>
    <p>UAB Information Security will be utilizing a continuous monitoring methodology for vulnerability management. This
        methodology of Discovery &amp; Validation, Risk Classification &amp; Notification, Vulnerability Remediation,
        and Verification of mitigation will occur in a cyclical basis. Additionally, UAB Information Security will
        maintain metrics to the vulnerability management program and report the status of issues to the University Risk
        Cabinet and other organizational leaders by unit on a quarterly basis.</p>
    <h3 id='s_5_0'>5.0 Un-remediated Systems</h3>
    <p>The CISO, or delegate, shall communicate directly with Information Security Liaisons and appropriate system
        administrators in advance regarding any action required to give the department the opportunity to respond. This
        communication relies upon accurate ownership information and staff contact information being available to the
        CISO and UAB Enterprise Information Security. In the absence of high-risk circumstances (i.e., a critical
        vulnerability being actively exploited against a relevant system), the CISO shall communicate at least five days
        in advance of any action to be taken. In the event of large-scale, high-risk vulnerabilities, the CISO may
        communicate campus-wide to all Information Security Liaison (ISL), Data Custodians, System Administrators, or
        other mass-communication paths regarding necessary remediation actions.</p>
    <p>High-impact actions such as blocking systems from the campus network shall require the joint approval of the Vice
        President of Information Technology and Chief Information Officer (CIO), and Associate Vice President and Chief
        Information Security Officer (or in their absence, CIO/CISO delegates) and may involve communication with
        appropriate unit leader.</p>
    <p>If a system is removed from the network for non-remediated vulnerabilities, the CISO may require additional
        controls or a control plan prior to allowing a system back on the campus network. The CISO must consider the
        risk sufficiently mitigated prior to authorizing network service restoration.</p>
    <p>The Enterprise Information Security Office will work in collaboration with internal University committees or
        programs to develop specific guidelines regarding un-remediated systems within the framework of this rule. These
        guidelines will be approved by the CISO and will balance the requirements of this rule with the potential
        negative impact to the mission of the University.</p>
    <h3 id='s_6_0'>6.0 Vulnerability Classifications</h3>
    <p>The following classifications describe the severity levels that can be assigned to a vulnerability. UAB IT
        utilizes multiple commercial and open-source tools to conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
        Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager is used to inventory assets and patch levels within windows-based
        systems. These tools provide output that maps into the NIST National Vulnerability Database with Common
        Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT
        Vulnerabilities. Validated findings will be assessed based on the risk of the system and data classification,
        and will be assigned vulnerability classification as listed below.</p>
    <p>End-of-life operating systems or applications are considered a critical vulnerability per CVSS scoring (CVSS Base
        Score of 10) and are not permitted for UAB business use under the <a
            href='https://www.uab.edu/it/home/images/UAB_Computing_Device_Standard_2017_Final.pdf'>Minimum Security for
            Computing Devices Rule</a>. These systems must be remediated expediently as would any other urgent
        classified vulnerability.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Level 5: Urgent</strong> -- denotes a vulnerability through which an intruder can easily gain control
            at the administrator level of any affected host. This class of vulnerability poses the highest risk for a
            system-wide compromise of the UAB campus network.</p>
        <p><em>Examples:</em> Domain administrator account compromise of UAB Active Directory.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 4: Critical</strong> -- denotes a vulnerability through which an intruder could gain access to
            an individual host at the administrator level or could possibly access Restricted/PHI or Sensitive data
            stored on that host. While this class of vulnerabilities is extremely serious, the risk of a break or
            compromise is not as urgent as with a level 5 vulnerability.</p>
        <p><em>Examples<strong>:</strong></em> Compromise of a server administrator account to an individual server,
            Internet-accessible remote code execution vulnerability of a system with Restricted/PHI Data or other
            sensitive data.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 3: Serious</strong> -- denotes a vulnerability that may allow an intruder to gain access to
            specific information stored on the host, including security settings. While not immediately associated with
            a compromise of an affected host, these vulnerabilities allow intruders to gain access to information that
            may be used to compromise the host in the future.</p>
        <p><em>Examples:</em> Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within a web application, malformed document
            which can cause an application to crash.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 2: Medium</strong> -- denotes a vulnerability through which intruders may be able to collect
            sensitive information from the host, such as the precise version of software installed. With this
            information, intruders can easily exploit known vulnerabilities specific to software versions.</p>
        <p><em>Examples:</em> Configuration issues with services presenting application versions in banners.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 1: Minimal</strong> -- denotes a vulnerability that do not pose an immediate threat to the host
            or the UAB campus network. These vulnerabilities refer mostly to weaknesses in a device that allow an
            intruder access to information that may be used in the future to compromise the host. Intruders can collect
            information about the host (open ports, services, etc.) and may be able use this information to find other
            vulnerabilities. Departments may opt to mitigate these vulnerabilities based on their network architecture
            or set up a timeframe for remediation based on the information stored on the device.</p>
        <p><em>Examples:</em> Open ports and services available on a particular device as identified by nmap.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Any identified vulnerabilities related to missing patches or improper configuration must be remediated within the
        timeframes specified below, or an exception must be in process or approved. For exception requests to be
        considered in process, relevant administrators must be working diligently toward approval, and Enterprise
        Information Security Office must have the exception request in hand. Remediation and mitigation should be
        prioritized based on the degree of associated severity, and the classification of data stored or processed by
        the system. For vulnerability remediation, administrators should perform effective testing and follow reasonable
        change management procedures to ensure patch installation for affected systems.</p>
    <h3 id='s_7_0'>7.0 Remediation and Mitigation Descriptions</h3>
    <p>After a vulnerability is detected, and a fix is available, a timeline for remediation begins. Level 5 (Urgent)
        vulnerabilities of mission-critical systems or those systems holding Restricted/PHI may require activation of
        the UAB Incident Response process for a critical incident at the direction of the CISO.</p>
    <p>For level 5 (Urgent) and level 4 (Critical) vulnerabilities for systems holding Restricted/PHI or Sensitive data
        and/or those systems designated as mission critical, exceptions to the timeline must be granted by the CISO or
        delegate. Any required remediation activity involving enterprise, mission critical systems must follow the UAB
        Enterprise Change Management process to deploy and test in an expedient manner and during agreed maintenance
        windows.</p>
    <p>For all other systems, departments are responsible for managing time exceptions on a case-by-case or
        blanket-exception basis and may establish appropriate procedures for managing those vulnerabilities within the
        stated timelines. Please note that in rare instances the CISO or delegate may determine that a specific
        vulnerability poses unacceptable risk to other UAB systems, in which case remediation may be required on a
        timeline determined by the CISO or delegate.</p>
    <p>Remediation is required within the listed periods unless a documented exception request has been submitted to
        Enterprise Information Security to &quot;halt the clock,&quot; and that exception is in process and being worked
        diligently by relevant administrators or has been approved. CISO-approved exceptions will document the specific
        remediation timeline requirements for that system or document compensating controls if remediation is not
        feasible, not necessary, or not appropriate.</p>
    <p><strong>Vulnerability Remediation Timeframes</strong></p>
    <h3 id='s_8_0'>8.0 Sanctions</h3>
    <p>Due to the significant level of risk tied to Urgent issues and the danger that they pose to UAB users and
        resources, failure to remediate Urgent issues within one day of notification will result in network access to
        the offending system(s) or applications(s) being terminated until the Urgent issue has been successfully
        remediated. Urgent issues involving enterprise, mission-critical systems must follow UAB Enterprise Change
        Management process to deploy any appropriate mitigation activities during maintenance windows and is not subject
        to this sanction.</p>
    <p>Any device that does not remediate vulnerabilities as outlined in this standard may be removed from the UAB
        network, disabled, etc., as appropriate until the device can comply with this standard or an exception request
        be approved.</p>
    <h3 id='s_9_0'>9.0 Exceptions</h3>
    <p>Exceptions may be granted in cases where security risks have mitigating controls in place to lessen the intensity
        from a critical to a minimal level. To request a security exception, complete the UAB Security Policy Exception
        request from the UAB IT portal.</p>
